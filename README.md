# Connect-Four-Game


Steps to play Connect-Four-Game:
1.Set Up: The game board consists of seven columns and six rows. Each player selects a color (traditionally red or yellow) and takes turns dropping one of their colored discs into the columns.

2.Take Turns: Players take turns dropping a disc from the top into any column of the grid. The disc falls down to the lowest unoccupied slot in that column.

3.Form a Line: The objective is to be the first to create a line of four of your own discs either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The line can be formed in any direction as long as it's four discs in a row.

4.Block Opponentâ€™s Moves: As you play, try to strategize by blocking your opponent's attempts to create their line of four while also working on your own strategy to win.

5.Winning: The game ends when one player successfully forms a line of four of their discs. Once a player has achieved this, they call out that they've connected four and the game stops.

6.Draw: If the grid fills up without either player forming a line of four, the game is a draw.

PLAY AND HAVE FUN!!!
